I have always wanted a Savotta tent of my own.
How much it has had costs in comparision to a night in a hotel?

And of course you need some [power](./power.md).

* A bit more than a luxury family room at the hotel
* No breakfast or room service
* Moist when wet, but car heater helps
* You have to clean your own mess
* The tent fabric requires maintenance
  * Stowe only dry
  * Re-apply shielding compounds after 2 year UV exposure
